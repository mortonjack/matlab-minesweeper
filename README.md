# Minesweeper

Console-based minesweeper project from the beginning of my degree, in my MATLAB & C course. 

# Features
- ASCII art of the minesweeper field
- Customisable board sizes & difficulty levels
- Save/Load functionality
- Generates image of the gameboard after you win/lose
- Flag tiles
- If you reveal a 0 tile, all 0 tiles it is connected to will be revealed using depth-first search

I had no idea what depth-first search was when I implemented the zero check! 
You can see the code in `zeroCheck.m` and `revealTile.m`

# Instructions
1. Open `main.m`
2. Click "Run"
3. Follow the instructions printed to your console
